Yes! Angular heavily uses OOP concepts:

Classes: Every component, service, and model in Angular is a class.
Encapsulation: Private and public properties help hide data.
Inheritance: Components and services can extend each other.
Abstraction: Services provide APIs without exposing internal details.
Polymorphism: Methods like ngOnInit() are defined in different classes but behave differently
